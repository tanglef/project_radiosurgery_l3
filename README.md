Radiosurgery and gamma rays : skeletonization algorithm

Project to complete a bachelor degree about the skeletonization of a shape (here a tumor) in order to project gamma rays onto it and fill out the most of the shape while not intersect the rays. <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;\lambda=3&plus;\exp{(-2&plus;i)}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\lambda=3&plus;\exp{(-2&plus;i)}" title="\lambda=3+\exp{(-2+i)}" /></a>

## Files

A pdf about the mathematical side of the project, included areas are :
  + discrete geometry,
  + topology,
  + differential geometry,
  + graph theory.

Also there are all the images. It ought to be able to produce the results (it may also take some time considering we didn't use an optimized algorithm for the boundaries detection).

## Remark

This was just a project to work on, a (better) version of a skeletonizating algorithm is already included in the skimage package.
